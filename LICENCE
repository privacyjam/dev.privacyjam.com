You can use this code for personal, public, or commercial projects.

For the design (HTML/CSS/JS):
- Keep my name somewhere — in the source, an about page, or a footer. Doesn’t have to be big or front-facing, but it must be visible.
- Don’t pretend you made it.

For my writing and visuals (blog posts, homepage text, game copy, favicon, etc.):
- Don’t rehost or resell them as-is.
- Don’t reuse them without credit.
- When reusing my written content or images, give VERY CLEAR credit — like, obviously visible.

For the Relay Life game:
- If you use or fork it, it must still say it was made by me.
- Credit should be visible *in* the game — like it already is.

No warranties. Use at your own risk.
