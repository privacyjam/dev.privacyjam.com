You can use this code for personal, public, or commercial projects.

For the design (HTML/CSS/JS):
- Keep my name somewhere — in a README, the source, an about page, or a footer. Doesn't have to be big or front-facing.
- Don't pretend you made it.

For my writing and visuals (blog posts, homepage text, game copy, favicon, etc.):
- Don't rehost or resell them as-is.
- Don't reuse them without credit.

For the Relay Life game:
- If you use or fork it, make sure it still says it was made by me.
- The credit should be visible in the game — like it already is.

No warranties. Use at your own risk.
