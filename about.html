  <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Privacy and freedom online have been an interest of mine for a while. Moving to a more connected world is great, but It comes with freedoms being able to be taken away with the click of a button.</p>
    <p>I believe everyone should be able to freely speak, browse, learn, and protest without being watched or silenced.</p>
    <p>I've seen how fast those freedoms have been removed in other countries from the safety of my home country, the U.S., but with Trump being back in office, It's become clear to many people including me, that our digital rights are crumbling beneath our feet, and being able to browse the web knowing somebody isn't tracking  you is a phrase you will never be able to say again.</p>
    <p>Realistically, I have my voice. My voice out in the vast world doesn't do much. So, I do what I can in a smaller environment; hosting Tor relays, advocating online, and teaching others how to protect and prioritize their online privacy and freedoms.</p>
    <p>I am always doing small things to educate and help others who may not be as fortunate to have as much knowledge as me, even access to that knowledge, that is why a big part of my advocacy is based around Tor, it allows people in countries with censorship to browse, speak, and lean freely without prying eyes.</p>
