  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>I'm passionate about online privacy and digital freedom. In a world increasingly dependent on technology, protecting our privacy isn't just important — it's essential.</p>
  <p>Living in the U.S. under Trump’s current administration, it's more obvious than ever how fragile our digital rights are.</p>
  <p>So I do what I can: advocating online, running Tor relays, and helping others understand why privacy matters.</p>
